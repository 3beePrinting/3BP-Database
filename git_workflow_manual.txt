# Git Workflow Manual

1. Navigate to Your Local Clone
   ```
   cd /path/to/your/repo
   ```
   *Description:* Changes your current directory to the root of your project where the Git repository is located.

2. Sync with the Remote Repository
   ```
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```
   *Description:* Switches to the main branch and fetches the latest commits from the remote 'origin', merging them into your local branch to ensure you're up to date.

3. Create & Switch to a New Branch
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```
   *Description:* Creates a new branch named 'feature/my-new-feature' and switches your working directory to this branch in one step.

4. Work on Your Code
   *Description:* Edit, add, or remove files in your editor/IDE. These changes remain untracked until you stage them.

5. Stage Changes for Commit
   ```
   git add file1.py dir/file2.js
   ```
   *Description:* Marks specific changed files to be included in the next commit.

6. Commit Your Changes
   ```
   git commit -m "Short, clear summary of changes"
   ```
   *Description:* Records a snapshot of your staged changes in the branch's history with a descriptive message.

7. Update Your Branch with Latest Main (Optional)
   ```
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```
   *Description:* Downloads new commits from 'main' and rebases your feature branch on top to keep history linear and reduce merge conflicts.

8. Push Your Branch to the Remote
   ```
   git push -u origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```
   *Description:* Uploads your local branch to the remote 'origin' and sets it as the upstream branch for easy future pushes and pulls.

9. Open a Pull Request (PR)
   *Description:* On your Git hosting platform (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket), create a PR to request merging your feature branch into 'main', facilitating code review and discussion.

10. Address Review Feedback & Iterate
    *Description:* Make additional commits on the same branch to address reviewer comments, then push the updates. The PR will update automatically.

11. Merge & Clean Up
    ```
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git branch -d feature/my-new-feature
    git push origin --delete feature/my-new-feature
    ```
    *Description:* Switch back to 'main', get the merged code, delete the local feature branch, and remove the remote branch to keep the repository tidy.
